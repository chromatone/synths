They’ve been combining it with dance and live instruments. Here’s a collection of some uses we’ve found on Twitter.</p><h2 id="can-i-use-it-to-make-my-own-songs" tabindex="-1">Can I use it to make my own songs? <a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-use-it-to-make-my-own-songs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Can I use it to make my own songs?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Yes.
