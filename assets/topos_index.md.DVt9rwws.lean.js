The Teletype is/was an open source hardware module for Eurorack synthesizers. While the Teletype was initially born as an hardware module, Topos aims to be a web-browser based cousin of it! It is a sequencer, a scriptable interface, a companion for algorithmic music-making. Topos wishes to fullfill the same goal as the Teletype, keeping the same spirit alive on the web. It is free, open-source, and made to be shared and used by everyone.
